# Fediverse Spam Filter

A spam filter for the Fediverse. It's designed for [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) and [Misskey](https://misskey-hub.net/) but should work with any ActivityPub-compatible software.

## Features

- **Self-hosted**: Run your own spam filter instance for your ActivityPub server, and have full control over the data.
- **Federated**: (Optionally) Share spam reports with other instances to improve spam detection.
- **Admin interface**: View and manage spam reports, and adjust the spam filter settings.
